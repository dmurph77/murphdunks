    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <h3 style="color: yellow;">Why are you doing this?</h3>
    <p>Three reasons:
    <ol>
        <li>I want to support charity, specifically Misericordia Heart of Mercy which is a fantastic cause close to my heart.</li>
        <li>I'd like some fun/funny external motivation to accomplish two athletic goals I've set for myself.</li>
        <li>I'm trying to learn how to build simple full-stack applications.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: yellow;">How do the bets work?</h3>
    <p>You can place a bet FOR or AGAINST each of Murphâ€™s goals. Winnings are split proportionally among those on the correct side of the bet.</p>

    <h3 style="color: yellow;">What happens to the money?</h3>
    <p>80% of all funds go to the winning side of each bet. 20% is donated to charity regardless of the outcome. I will store the pots in a FDIC-insured money market fund until payouts.</p>

    <h3 style="color: yellow;">Is this real money? How can I trust you?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Payments are collected by Stripe (a very common 3rd party payment platform). Hopefully, if you are wagering you know and trust me personally. If you don't, all I can say is that I am doing this for charity, and am a lot less sketchy than the typical crypto flavor of the day.</p>

    <h3 style="color: yellow;">How will you handle payouts?</h3>
    <p>Payouts will be done manually via venmo. I will collect your venmo handle at time of bet entry.</p>

    <h3 style="color: yellow;">Is this legal?</h3>
    <p>This platform is designed as a novelty prediction market with charitable donations and no guaranteed returns. It's not a licensed gambling operation.</p>

    <h3 style="color: yellow;">How is success determined?</h3>
    <p>Success will be defined as:
      <ol>
        <li>Marathon: Official race time via Chicago Marathon 2025 site.</li>
        <li>Dunk: clean dunk with a regulation women's ball on a 10 ft. hoop. Ratified by multiple witnesses and video.</li>
      </ol>
